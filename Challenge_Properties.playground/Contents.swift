# Challenge Time! ğŸ˜ƒ
Create a struct named `Temperature` with properties for degrees in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, as `Double`s.
* _Hint 1_: One property must be stored, but the other can be computed. They should always stay in sync.
* _Hint 2_: To convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, subtract 32, then divide by 1.8.
